          Each submission records detailed metadata such as attempt order, time taken per question, and correctness,
          enabling structured performance analysis and downstream machine learning experimentation. The platform is
          built using FastAPI with PostgreSQL for persistence and server-rendered templates for a clean, responsive UI.

          This project implements a chat-based personal loan application system where users interact with a chatbot instead
          of filling traditional forms. The chatbot collects loan requirements, understands free-text inputs such as loan
          amount and income, guides users through basic negotiation, performs identity verification, and evaluates eligibility
          using predefined loan rules. Conversational responses are enhanced using the Groq API, while all loan approval and
          rejection decisions are handled through deterministic business logic. Approved applications result in an automatically
          generated loan sanction letter that can be downloaded directly from the chat interface.
