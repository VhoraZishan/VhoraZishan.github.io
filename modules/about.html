      👋 Hi, I’m Zishan — a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in backend development, cloud platforms,
      and how systems are deployed and maintained behind the scenes. I’m more inclined toward building APIs,
      working with databases, and understanding how different services interact rather than focusing purely on UI.<br><br>

      I enjoy breaking down technical problems and learning by actually building things. Most of my experience comes
      from hands-on projects where I’ve worked on backend logic, integrated databases, and deployed applications across
      different platforms. Along the way, I’ve learned a lot by debugging issues, refining workflows, and iterating on
      real systems.<br><br>

      While I’m still early in my journey, I’m actively strengthening my backend and cloud fundamentals through
      experimentation and self-driven learning. I’m open to internships, freelance opportunities, and collaborative
      projects that allow me to gain practical experience and contribute to meaningful technical work.
